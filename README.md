[**David Restaurant Web Application**](https://cmn0705.github.io/David_Restaurant_Website/index.html)

The front page of our web app contains 3 clickable tiles: Menu, Specials, and Map. If you click on the Specials tile, you will be taken to a single category page where all the menu items that belong to the Specials menu category will be shown. When the user clicks on the Specials tile, the web app takes the user to a random single category menu page, listing menu items in the category, be it "Lunch", "Dinner", "Sushi", etc. That way, any random category can become the Specials!

**Verify that the desired functionality is working correctly**
  * Click here: [David Restaurant Web Application](https://cmn0705.github.io/David_Restaurant_Website/index.html)
  * Click on the Specials tile. A single page category with a list of menu items for **some** category should appear.
  * Click on the restaurant logo to go back to the home page.
  * Click on the Specials tile again. Most likely, a different single page category page will be shown.
